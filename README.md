# Warden
Warden is a TShock plugin that tracks all item drops with unique IDs and stores them in a database. It scans player inventories, removes untracked items, and detects cheating via illegal items or oversized stacks. Designed to protect Terraria servers from item-based exploits and maintain fair gameplay.
